以下是2024年9月份英文授課“數理統計”課程的學生期末心得分享。和各位同學分享！

## I am still thinking if this course should be tought in English. Please provide me roughly 200 words (both English or Chinese are okay) explaining why it should be tought in Enligh.

"After taking EMI Math Statistics courses, I think I have improved my skills in both math statistics and English presentation.The course being taught in English offers a valuable opportunity for us to improve our ability to express mathematical concepts and logic in an international language. In our current education, we rarely have chances to present mathematical ideas or formulas in English, which is a crucial skill for future academic and professional development. This class would help bridge the gap by encouraging us to think about how to explain math-related content clearly and accurately in English. Moreover, English is widely used in academic research and global collaboration. Learning to communicate mathematical logic in English can prepare students for participating in international conferences, publishing papers, or working in multinational teams. It also allows us to understand English materials more efficiently, such as research papers or textbooks that are often unavailable in other languages. Overall, offering this course in English not only builds language skills but also prepares students to engage effectively in the global academic and professional community."

我覺得有些專有名詞用中文講的話，之後在看做題目的時候會銜接不上，因為題目也都還是英文的。而且用英文上課，因為是比較不熟悉的語言，所以會比較專心在聽課。再來，平時除了英文課的課程幾乎沒有什麼課是用英文授課，像是這門課的課堂作業講解用英文上課，可以幫助我更了解某些數學用語在英文上的用法，不然可能都沒什麼機會糾正自己的錯誤。尤其是數理統計這種在應用上幾乎需要全部使用英文的學科更是用英文授課，讓學生能夠在之後更自然的運用。

### 3
數理統計被應用在機器學習與其他重要理論中，用英文授課的話，如果能聽懂且看懂講義，在當下去看課本做為一個知識的補充就會是一個不錯的選擇，如果之後要更深入理解是看論文或其他書籍，也會比較輕鬆，因為這部分的資源通常是英文的，如果翻成中文就會有哪裡怪怪的。純粹內心想法:自己經歷過兩次有關機率的課都是英文授課的，因此也還好，但也希望學弟妹不能讓他們太輕鬆。

### 4
雖然說英文上課有相對的優點，但有些觀念用中文說會讓學生更容易熟悉，在接觸不熟悉的領域時，用平常習慣的方式去學習成效會比較好，但畢竟題目是用英文出的，所以有些專有名詞等還是要用英文教過，最好的方法就是雙語教學，學生更容易進入狀況。

### 5
我覺得平常上課有一個機會可以讓我們說英文，甚至是用英文講解問題很酷，但其實我覺得平常作業勾題都是英文，PPT也是英文，就有強迫我們用英文接收這些知識了，是不是用英文授課也沒有什麼差，但就算真的用英文授課我也覺得還好，因為印象中這學期沒有聽到什麼很困難會讓我當下聽不懂的英文單字，確實讓外籍生比較好上課（雖然最後好像大部分都退掉了），但就是有時候用中文講我們會比較方便提出問題，不然光是把自己的問題翻成英文就要想半天，而且有些比較難的觀念可能用中文我就已經很蛤了，用一個不熟悉的語言更是。

I think that there are several advantages of teaching this course in English. First, English English is the predominant language for academic research, publications, and communication in the field of statistics. Thus, learning this course in English students are much easier to find information on internet.
Second, using English helps students become familiar with technical terms and phrases commonly used in statistics. Although our native language is Chinese, some technique terms are hard to explain in Chinese. Mastery of this vocabulary in English reduces barriers to understanding global resources, textbooks, and tools. Teaching in English also helps students access a wider range of international resources. Many high-quality textbooks, academic papers, online courses (such as those on Coursera and edX), and documentation for statistical software (like R and Python libraries) are written in English. Familiarity with English instruction allows students to more easily utilize these resources, enabling them to delve deeper into the study of statistics and stay updated with the latest developments in the field. This skill is particularly valuable for students aiming for advanced studies or research careers, as they need to quickly comprehend and apply knowledge and tools from around the world. Third, teaching in English aligns with the growing demand for professionals who can work in multinational teams or pursue careers abroad. Many industries, such as finance, data science, and tech, require employees to understand and communicate statistical concepts in English."

我覺得中文教學學生理解一定比較容易，但英文教學的好處在於我們可以習慣英語思考，只要撐過前面比較痛苦的時期就能有大幅的進步，而上台報告的部分我覺得滿妙的，起初我每次想到要上台都會不由得緊張，尤其是看到英語好的同學，但隨著上台次數增加以及發現多數同學都講得跟我差不多後，後來也沒有甚麼感覺了，這堂課可能目標群體就是給那些有覺悟的同學來修的哈哈

### 8
數理統計課程的課本和上課簡報皆為為英文，英文授課能減少轉換語言可能產生的偏差，例如每周出自課本習題的作業就是以英文描述。
我曾在修課過程中聽聞同學表示英文教學和英文作業發表難度較高，但在學期中後每位同學皆能熟捻的進行報告，若有名詞符號的疑惑也會自行查找網路或是在課間以中文詢問。可見英文授課並不是對學習的阻礙。以上是我的想法，最後祝教授佳節愉快。

Teaching this course in English is highly beneficial for several reasons. First, English is the global language of academia and business, and using it ensures that students are equipped with the skills they need to succeed internationally. It opens up access to a wealth of academic resources, including textbooks, research articles, and online platforms, most of which are predominantly in English. This makes it easier for students to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in their field. Second, English proficiency is increasingly valued in the job market. In many industries, particularly in multinational corporations, English is the common language used for communication, making it essential for students to be able to read, write, and speak in English. By teaching the course in English, students will gain the confidence to participate in global discussions, attend international conferences, and collaborate with peers and professionals worldwide.
Finally, teaching in English encourages cognitive flexibility and cultural awareness. Students will not only learn the subject matter but also develop their language skills and cross-cultural communication abilities. This will prepare them for a variety of global opportunities, enhancing both their academic and professional futures."

我認為數理統計用英文授課雖然會增加一點理解上的問題，但是也能訓練到英文聽跟說的能力。這門課我覺得可以訓練到英文口說的機會，每周的上台講解作業就是蠻好的方式強迫每個人都要準備一小段presentation ，而有時上課隨機抽問回答也或多或少可以鍛鍊口說能力，不過因為這種方式沒辦法事前準備，可能導致沒辦法立刻將答案組織成完整的語句來回答，更多是在訓練臨場的英文對答方面。


## Any other comments you would like to share with students in the next course, i.e., 202509?  (both English or Chinese are okay)

First, AI tools can be very helpful in assisting with assignments and making your work more efficient. These tools can provide quick solutions or suggestions, especially for brainstorming or repetitive tasks. However, it’s important to remember that AI is not always correct. Sometimes, even if you point out its mistakes, it may not provide the revised right answers.
When you encounter difficulties that AI cannot solve, don’t hesitate to ask for help from your TAs or professors. They are experienced and are always willing to help you understand the concepts better. Their guidance can save you time and ensure you’re on the right track. Lastly, stay curious and proactive in your studies. Don’t be afraid to try solving problems on your own first. This will not only improve your problem-solving skills but also make the course more rewarding."

不要害怕用英文講話，雖然一開始的時候我們也都會怕講錯，但是到後面大家都越來越熟練。如果不好意思在課堂上發問，也可以像我一樣在下課的時候詢問老師問題，當然你也可以先問你身旁的同學。寫作業的時候我也會問ChatGPT，但是我都是先看完題目，然後自己思考完要怎麼做之後，才跟他對答案。不要完全依賴ChatGPT，實際上他時常給我錯誤的答案，他在數學方面的解題並不是完全正確的。使用GitHub也可以讓你更熟悉Latex的語法，像我在排版的時候，就學會不同的表現方式。

### 3
微積分還是需要多加練習，很多時候解題和理解概念時，能寫出某部分公式，但卻會因為微積分卡住，導致無法理解與算出結果

### 4
英文很重要

"我覺得這堂課是除了資結以外我修過最硬的課QQ可能是因為我不夠認真。在網路上看到有人說2021的期中考分數差到全班重考嚇死人，但這次的期中考還好啦....
但是要背證明！要記得寫範圍！不要作業都是連續的就以為考連續！！結果都考離散的啊啊啊啊"

I think that mathematical statistics is a challenging course, requiring a significant amount of time for review and preparation in order to learn it effectively. However, studying this course is highly beneficial for future endeavors, particularly in financial data analysis and business-related fields. Therefore, I think this course is definitely worth taking.

### 7
我覺得上課期間課堂練習滿有幫助的，可以逼我們思考以及應用公式，最重要的是確保我們有吸收進去，不會的部分可以立刻解決不用拖到課後在自己花時間補救，只是很花時間，所以在上課跟練習之間可能要找尋一個平衡點
然後作業其實也滿有幫助的(程式部分除外，到最後都是chatgpt實際上沒學到甚麼)，好好寫可以學到很多，只是每周花好幾個小時然後才1%很痛苦，擠壓到很多時間(最好的方法就是增加%數，學生就會乖乖任命寫了哈哈)"

Not recommended for students that haven't finished Calculus course.

If you're considering this course in the next semester, be prepared for an engaging yet challenging experience. The course content is well-structured and incorporates real-life applications, especially in finance and time series analysis. Be sure to keep up with the homework and use the additional resources, such as YouTube videos and the AI platform, which will be very helpful for understanding core concepts. The pace might be fast, so actively participate in class activities and don't hesitate to ask for clarification if needed. Also, make sure to review the proprietary terms and definitions, as they can be tricky. Overall, it's a rewarding course, and with consistent effort, you'll find it very valuable!

我覺得這是一門蠻紮實的課，雖然課程中的部分內容我在之前修課時也有碰到過，但是這門課我還是修的稍微有些吃力。我覺得上課中簡報內的例題算是最重要的部分，它們大多是用來說明某一條公式或概念的應用，所以理解的例題也就能大概明白這段內容的重點，而且部分作業和考試也蠻有可能會從裡面出。


## Any other comments you would like to share with me?

"Thank you for putting so much effort into helping us work towards the 2030 bilingual goal! I really appreciate how you’re trying out creative teaching methods and even discussing them with us to make the course better. It’s nice to see a teacher who listens to students and is open to change—it makes learning feel more interactive.

The bilingual approach might feel a bit challenging at first, but it’s honestly such a great way to help us prepare for the future. Plus, experimenting with different ways to teach keeps things interesting and shows how much you care about our learning experience.

Thanks again for being so open and dedicated to improving the course for all of us!"

希望之後的PPT可以同步改正錯誤，因為有些在課堂上改正的，但其他地方並沒有一起更改。還有有些課堂沒講到的題目，也希望能夠一併提供答案讓我們知道正確答案應該要是怎麼呈現，謝謝。我們知道老師希望我們能夠培養與人的溝通能力，謝謝老師的用心。

### 3
我覺得in class exercise 可以取消，因為有些人包括我，是沒辦法聽完馬上就有辦法去做題目的，需要更多的是課後的吸收，我覺得能把in class exercise 當作功課 之後再檢討更好。

白板筆的墨水常常看不到

### 5
然後雖然不願意承認但不得不說每週上去講作業真的蠻有用的，統計二的時候講那次我就超緊張，但這學期到後來幾乎每個禮拜都要上去講，我就不緊張了耶。
然後助教真的很好，請幫他加薪"

I think the usage of E3 and GitHub should be clearly differentiated: E3 should be used for announcements and providing course-related information, while GitHub should be designated for assignments and assignment reports.

I appreciate the effort you put into making the course engaging and comprehensive. The added use of YouTube videos and AI platforms will greatly enhance our understanding. It would be helpful if we could have more practice opportunities before exams to solidify key concepts. Additionally, a bit more time for clarification of core concepts during lectures would be beneficial. Looking forward to the upcoming semester!

我覺得三堂課有其中一堂完全用來報告對我來說可能有點太多了，我覺得可能頻率可能可以降低一些。另外我覺得同學上台講解題目我有時比較不能夠聽懂解法，我覺得像是老師在期末考前臨時錄的那題講解就解釋的相當清楚，可能可以考慮把作業裡面困難的題目由老師講解或是可能可以把這些題目放在講義裡面當作上課的例題，我覺得這樣我會更容易吸收到習題內容。
