## Map

I was born in Taoyuan city, a beautiful countyside in the northern part of Taiwan. 
I went to Taipei since senior high school, and was an exchange student in Austria during undergraduate study. 
I then seek Ph.D. in Statitics at Penn State, USA. 
I was very blassed to have my first job at National Central University. 
Now, I am a Professor at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu.

## Food

I love desserts, but as time goes on, I am now a careful part-time nutritionist.

## Smiles

I love outdoor activities with family, watch a lot of internet vedios about history and civilization, and love to do investment and trading.
