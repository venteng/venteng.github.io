### Map

I was born in Taoyuan City, a charming countryside area in northern Taiwan.
For high school, I moved to Taipei, and during my undergraduate years, I had the wonderful opportunity to be an exchange student in Austria.
I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from Penn State, USA.
I feel incredibly fortunate to have started my academic career at National Central University.
Now, I am a Professor at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.

### Food

I’ve always loved desserts, but over time, I’ve also become a mindful part-time nutritionist.

### Smiles

I love spending time outdoors with my family, enjoy watching online videos about history and civilization, and have a strong passion for investing and trading.
