Mathematics in Modern Finance: Applications in FinTech, Derivatives, and Risk Management

Many students hesitate when choosing a university major—I was no exception. During my undergraduate years, I faced significant academic challenges, which led me to question my path. In my master’s studies, I shifted towards applied fields and discovered new opportunities. This transition eventually led me to pursue a Ph.D. in statistics, deepening my expertise before joining academia. I have since taught at the Institute of Statistics at National Central University and currently at the Department of Information Management and Finance at NYCU. My research now focuses on financial statistics, machine learning, credit scoring, financial derivatives, and wealth and risk management. These areas illustrate how mathematics is deeply embedded in modern finance and AI applications. In this talk, I will share my academic journey, key turning points, and how mathematical concepts translate into real-world financial innovations. Through this discussion, I hope to demonstrate that mathematics is not just abstract theory—it is a powerful tool shaping the future of finance.

數學的奇幻旅程：從大學課堂到金融 AI 應用

摘要
許多人在選擇大學科系時，或多或少都會猶豫，當初的我也抱持著相似的疑問。大學期間，我經歷了巨大的學習上的挫折。碩士班時，我轉向應用領域，發現的另一個領域的美好！博士班則深入統計研究，最終走入學術界：在中央大學統計所與陽明交大資財系任教。如今，我的研究涵蓋財務統計、機器學習、信用評分、衍生性金融商品，以及財富與風險管理等領域，將數學應用於金融與 AI 世界。最後我會介紹陽明交大資財系以及應用數學系。本次演講，我將分享這段旅程中的心路歷程與關鍵轉折，讓大家看到數學不只是抽象的理論，而是一把開啟無限可能的鑰匙！
