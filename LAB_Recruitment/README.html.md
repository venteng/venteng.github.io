# LAB Recruitment

Our lab is looking for students who are passionate about knowledge, value transparency and reproducibility in scientific research, and demonstrate resilience and a positive outlook. We focus on using cutting-edge quantitative methods — including statistical techniques, machine learning, and AI — to tackle real-world challenges.

## TOGETHER, WE GO FAR!

- If you’re driven by curiosity and eager to make a difference, join us as we explore these exciting topics together! 
- See a list of achievements of [Students](https://venteng.github.io/LAB_Recruitment/Students.html)! 
- If you are interested in joining our lab, please submit your transcripts and a short statement of purpose (less than 150 words) by Dec 15, 2025. A decision will be made around Dec 25, 2025.  
- Enrolling in my [Machine Learning & FinTech](https://github.com/HWTeng-Teaching/202409-ML-FinTech) course is a great way to gain valuable insights and skills for our research projects — while it’s not mandatory, it’s highly recommended!
