# TOGETHER, WE GO FAR!

## Join Our Lab!

In our lab, you will be trained to write a high-quality master’s thesis with the potential to become a journal publication (preferably in SCIE or SCI journals). You can find examples of [previous lab members](https://venteng.github.io/LAB_Recruitment/Students.html) whose master’s research led to published papers — a great way to see what’s possible when you commit to excellence.

We emphasize research that is transparent, reproducible, and contributes meaningfully to the literature.

We’re looking for students who demonstrate:
- Passion and curiosity for learning
- Strong execution and resilience
- Leadership and teamwork spirit
- Good presentation and communication skills
- Solid foundations in math, statistics, machine learning, coding, and finance

If you’re driven, curious, and eager to make your research count — we’d love to work with you.

My research spans several key areas, with Lab Members actively collaborating on ongoing projects across these domains.

### 1. FinTech with machine learning and AI

Our lab explores machine learning and AI, emphasizing unsupervised learning, supervised learning, and large language models (LLMs), with applications
- Credit scoring (Mabel, Eva)
- Fraud detection (Chrissy)
- Trading strategies and portfolio management (Ben, Deron, Ares, Elvis)

### 2. Financial engineering with time series and graphical models

We specialize in statistical methods, particularly time series and graphical models, wich applications
- Financial Risk managemet: VaR, graphical models (Jason, Martin, Frank, Guan-Lin, Yi-Le) 
- Financial options pricing, and dynamic hedging: Cryptocurrencies and Taiwan Futures Market (Allen, Elvis)

## Interested in joining? 

Let’s make an impact together!
- Enrolling in my [Machine Learning & FinTech](https://github.com/HWTeng-Teaching/202409-ML-FinTech) course is a great way to build relevant skills for our research — it’s highly recommended but not required.  
- Email me your CV, transcripts, and a short statement of purpose (150 words max).
