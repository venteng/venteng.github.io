## Objectives of Section 1

Section 1 should include:

- (a) A literature review covering 3–5 relevant introductory topics  
- (b) A clear statement of the study's goals and its significance to society

The goal is to convince your readers why your research matters — not only in academia, but also in the real world.

Before proposing your research objectives, explore the broader context thoroughly with the help of both traditional methods and AI tools.

## Literature Review Workflow

### 📌 Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Identify Key Topics
Select 3 to 5 core themes relevant to your research area.

#### 2. Use AI for Article Discovery
For each topic:

- Ask your favorite AI (e.g., ChatGPT or Claude) to generate a list of relevant academic papers
- Request BibTeX citations from the AI
- Use Google Scholar or publisher sites to fact-check and validate each paper

#### 3. Tabulate & Structure the Findings
- Summarize findings in a clear table or matrix
- Structure the information into presentation-ready slides for communicating to a general audience

#### 4. Manage Citations
- Compile sources into a BibTeX file
- Upload to Overleaf for easy reference management

#### 5. Iterate with Other AI Tools
- Repeat the process using different AI tools
- Refine until your review is comprehensive and well-structured
