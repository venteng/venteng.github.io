Dear COST network

I hope you’re all doing well. On behalf of Charles Martinez, G-Research, I wanted to share that G-Research, an associate partner in our MSCA Industrial Doctoral Network on Digital Finance, has just launched internship applications for the following positions:
Internship in Quantitative Research

Machine Learning Research Internship

Additionally, their Spring Week applications  are now open.

It would be greatly appreciated if you could share these opportunities with your students or anyone in your network who might be interested.

Many thanks in advance for your support!

Best regards
Joerg
